# My name is William, but I usually go by Gabe, which is short for my middle name, Gabriel. We have two Williams in my family, so it makes it easier to distinguish between me and the man that I was named after.
# I'd like to think I have a practical approach to my career, keeping in mind that I need to make money to live, so I have to take what I get for employment in this field or I'd likely go hungry. That being considered, I would like to work on developing an RPG. Mainly just for fun. I've been composing and producing music for about ten years, messing with art, writing, and running D&D campaigns for about seven years, and all of those hobbies have culminated in the desire to see my fictional world come to life. That is probably the greatest passion I have in life.
